Q1. Find the Median
Mr. X is a student of Computer Science. He is facing a problem and  needs your help to solve it.
The problem is, you will be given N integer numbers( 4<n<=100) which are arranged side by side (x1,x2,x3,x4,.....).
Now you have to sort those items in ascending order. After doing this , your job is to print the items in a sorted way and find the median.
[NB: when N is odd  , Median= (N+1)/2; When N is even Median= (N/2)+1 ]
