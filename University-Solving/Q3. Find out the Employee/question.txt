Q3. Find out the Employee
Suppose, you are working as a Data Entry Operator in a company. You have created a dataset that contains the names of N employees. Then your supervisor wants you to look for a particular employee by name. (Consider, every name in the data set is unique).
Now your task is to write a program which will help you to find out the name which your supervisor is looking for.
If found then print a message "Matched" otherwise print "Not Matched". (N.B: Without quotation) 

The first line of input will take an integer (N) which indicates the number of names in the dataset. 
Then the second line will take N space-separated strings. The third line of input will take another string as search value.  

Sample input:

Sample output:

Sample input:
